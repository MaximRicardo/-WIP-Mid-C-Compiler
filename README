MCC/Mid C Compiler

    This is a work-in-progress C Compiler written entirely in C89 with no
non-standard or external libraries or macros.
    The eventual goal of this project is to bootstrap the compiler. In other
words, full C89 compatibility. Well, I guess you don't need full compatibility
to compile this compiler because it doesn't use every part of C89, but you need
support for most of it.
    Anyways, thats why I'm writing the compiler in C89, to make it
easier to bootstrap.

Thus far the compiler has:
    variables
    multiple variable types
    function definitions
    function calls
    function prototyping
    return statements

Next thing I'ma implement:
    void types

    Also, the compiler has a custom debugging keyword ':', which prints the
value current stored in RAX.
