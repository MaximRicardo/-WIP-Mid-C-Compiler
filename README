MCC/Mid C Compiler

    This is a work-in-progress C Compiler written entirely in C89 with no
non-standard or external libraries or macros.
    The eventual goal of this project is to port it to a custom ISA.

Thus far the compiler has:
    variables
    multiple variable types (char, int)
    function definitions
    function calls
    function prototyping
    return statements
    function argument error checking
    if/else statements
    pointers
    arrays

Next thing I'ma implement:
    while loops
    for loops

    Also, the compiler has a custom debugging keyword ':', which prints the
value currently stored in EAX.
