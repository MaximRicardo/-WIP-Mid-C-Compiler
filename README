MCC/Mid C Compiler

    This is a work-in-progress C Compiler written entirely in C89 with no
non-standard or external libraries or macros.
    The eventual goal of this project is to port it to a custom ISA, and write
an OS in it.
    Currently the compiler uses an x86 backend but that's cuz I haven't
actually made the ISA yet. Also x86 is easy to use cuz it has a bunch of
pre-built debuggers and I get to use glibc.

Thus far the compiler has:
    variables
    multiple variable types (char, int)
    function definitions
    function calls
    function prototyping
    return statements
    function argument error checking
    if/else statements
    pointers
    arrays
    while loops
    for loops
    typedefs
    type casts

Next thing I'ma implement:
    static functions
    global variables

    Also, the compiler has a custom debugging keyword ':', which prints the
value currently stored in EAX.
