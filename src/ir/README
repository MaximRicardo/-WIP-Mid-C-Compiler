MCCIR/Mid C Compiler Intermediate Representation

    MCCIR is an Intermediate Language designed for easy optimization. The IR is
in SSA format.

Notable Instructions:

    je REG_0/IMM_0, REG_1/IMM_1, LABEL_2

Jumps to LABEL if the first and second arguments are equal.

    alloca REG_0, IMM_0, IMM_1

This instruction allocates IMM_0 bytes of space on the stack, with an alignment
of IMM_1 bytes, and puts a ptr to the start of the allocated space in REG_0.
The specified alignment MUST be a power of 2.

    store REG_0/IMM_0, REG_1, REG_2/IMM_2

Stores the first argument at the second argument offset by the third
argument (in bytes).

    load REG_0, REG_1, REG_2/IMM_2

Loads the value at the second argument offset by the third argument (in bytes),
into the first argument.
