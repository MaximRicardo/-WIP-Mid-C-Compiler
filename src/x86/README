DEPRECATED!
USE MCCIR FOR CODE GENERATION INSTEAD!

The IR is allowed to use the following registers for instructions:
    AX, BX, CX
The rest of the registers can be used by code_gen whenever it needs extra
registers for something. For example, SI is used to temporarily hold the
immediate right operand in divisions like 5/3.
